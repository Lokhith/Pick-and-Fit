// This is just for demonstration of what needs to be updated in product cards
// For example, in components/popular-products.tsx, update the product cards to:

/*
<Link href={`/product/${product.id}`}>
  <div className="product-card">
    ...
  </div>
</Link>
*/

// Similarly update all instances where product cards are rendered to include links to the product detail page
